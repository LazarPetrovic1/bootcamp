### 1.2 Knowledge Check

Questions:
1. Most cyberattacks today are perpetrated by internal threat actors such as malicious employees engaging in corporate espionage. T/F
2. Describe the different motivations of various adversaries including cybercriminals, cyberterrorists, state-sponsored organizations, and hacktivists. (Discussion)
3. The Cyber-Attack Lifecycle is a five-step process that an attacker goes through to attack a network. T/F
4. List and describe the steps of the Cyber-Attack Lifecycle.
5. An attacker needs to succeed in executing only one step of the Cyber-Attack Lifecycle to infiltrate a network, whereas a defender must “be right every time” and break every step of the chain to prevent an attack. T/F
6. Which technique is not used to break the command-and- control (C&C) phase of the Cyber-Attack Lifecycle? (Choose one.)

+ blocking outbound traffic to known malicious sites and IP addresses
+ DNS sinkholing and DNS poisoning
+ vulnerability and patch management
+ all of the above
