5. Unlike file-based malware scanning that waits until an entire file is loaded into memory to begin scanning, stream-based malware scanning begins scanning as soon as the first packets of the file are received. Stream-based malware scanning reduces latency and improves performance by receiving, scanning, and sending traffic to its intended destination immediately, without having to first buffer and then scan the file.
6. Templates eliminate manual, repetitive, risky, and error-prone configuration changes to multiple, individual firewalls deployed throughout the enterprise network.
7. [d] traditional port-based firewalls
___

### 3.3 Knowledge Check

3. What are the three keys to safely enabling mobile devices in the enterprise?

Answers:
1. True
2. The Traps agent injects itself into each process as it is started. If the process attempts to execute any of the core attack techniques, the corresponding EPM kills the process and prevents the exploit.

### 3.4 Knowledge Check

Questions:
1. (blank) provides continuous monitoring of public clouds and helps organizations achieve a continuous state of compliance in their public cloud workloads.
2. What are some of the organizational security risks associated with unsanctioned SaaS application usage?
3. Explain why traditional perimeter-based firewalls are not effective for protecting data in SaaS environments.
4. Aperture is deployed as a standalone inline service between the organization’s traditional perimeter-based firewalls and requires a software agent to be installed on mobile devices. T/F
5. Aperture protects data in hosted files and application entries. T/F

Answers:
1. Evident
2. The organizational security risks associated with unsanctioned SaaS application usage include regulatory non-compliance or compliance violations, loss of corporate intellectual property (IP) or other sensitive data, and malware distribution.
3. Traditional perimeter-based firewalls only have visibility of traffic that passes through the firewall. SaaS applications and data can be accessed from mobile devices that don’t necessarily traverse a perimeter-based firewall, and many SaaS-based applications are designed to circumvent firewalls for performance and ease of use.
4. False. Aperture is used to protect sanctioned SaaS usage, as part of an integrated security solution that includes NGFWs to prevent unsanctioned SaaS use. Aperture communicates directly with the SaaS applications themselves and therefore does not need to be deployed inline and does not require any software agents, proxies, additional hardware, or network configuration changes.
5. True
